This is a version I made for use by an american football Semi Pro team. 
This version allows users to edit their own entry if they are on the system and linked to their record. 
It also allows it to be a way to register to be a player as well. 

I have been asked to release this to the community at this time. 

Please be aware that the original module appeared like it was thrown together with little thought of being xoops compatible and I modified it with little knowledge of xoops API at the time as well.

This module was written for Xoops 2.4.5 but appears to work fine in 2.5.5 at this time. 

Also please be aware that I plan to totally rewrite this program as a testing base for a new Profile program. I am calling this more of a profile lite but it will be a test of some new features that will be compatible with similar features in profile. 

Because of my intent to rewrite this module from scratch I will not support this module at this time. I have a couple other projects to complete first as well as finishing up the semester so it will likely be sometime in the summer of 2013 before I will address this.
